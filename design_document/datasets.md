# Brief description of the datasets I will use for this project

### For package validation the following datasets will be employed from Qian et al [PMID: 32561858]

## Real dataset for answering a biological question using the tool

This dataset has been widely cited and employed in many downstream studies. It contains four different types of cancers so users can have more flexibility to select the cancer type that they are interested in. 
In the tutorial I am interested in looking at the TFs which are activated in cancer cell types. Each dataset has cancer cells, therefore, it is an ideal dataset to investigate cancer agnostic transcription factor activity. At the end of the analysis, I am expecting a set of TFs which are shown to be up in cancer cells and is generated from three different methods. 

- Breast cancer scRNA-seq data [44,024 cells]
- Colorectal scRNA-seq data [30,626 cells]
- Lung cancer scRNA-seq data [66,309 cells]
- Ovarian cancer scRNA-seq data [34,469 cells]

The RDS file for these datasets can be downloaded from here:

Ideally processed data with raw counts
This file will be provided by the users
